[Unfollow Everything developer banned for life from Facebook services for creating plug-in to clean up news feed](https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/facebook-unfollow-everything-cease-desist.html)

This article was written by a programmer who wrote Unfollow Everything, a free tool to eliminate Facebook's News Feed. He wanted to do this to remove the addictive nature that the platform brings while still preserving Facebook's functionality as a social hub. After a few months of publishing Unfollow Everything, Facebook sent the author a cease and desist letter as well as permanantely deactivating his Facebook and Instagram accounts.

I found this article interesting since it presents both the good and evil involved in computer science in today's market. In my opinion, the author made this app with good intentions, freeing those suffering from overstimulation. Yet Facebook, a multi-trillion dollar industry that feeds off social addiction to thrive, decides to do everything in its power to destroy the author's work. This really shows how much money (and greed) influences technological development. The News Feed, which does more harm than good to society, ultimately prevails over Unfollow Everything, which selflessly offers a way to make Facebook a tool rather than a drug. The sad reality of life is many people and organizations are selfish, willing to use technology to put others down, just for their own monetary gain.
